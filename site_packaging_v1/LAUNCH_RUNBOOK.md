## 1. THE PRODUCT (What we are selling)

Zero@Production is not a sustainability dashboard.
It is an Operating System for Sustainable Production.

It connects:
• Factory Reality (Production, Energy, Transport)
• Digital Reality (IT, AI, Cloud)
• Market Reality (Retail, Distribution, Margin)

Into one single truth:
"Decision-First Sustainability."
