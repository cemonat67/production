# Zero@Production — v1.1 Backlog Manifesto

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** LOCK  
**Philosophy:** "Conscious Exclusion"

This document lists features we **deliberately** excluded from v1.0 to preserve the purity of the "Decision Architecture". They are candidates for v1.1, but only if they serve the OS logic.

---

## 1. Integration & Connectivity

*   **[EXCLUDED] Bi-Directional ERP Sync (SAP/Oracle)**
    *   *Reason:* v1.0 must prove the *logic* first. Hard-wiring into SAP creates a 6-month sales cycle. v1.0 works with "Ingest" (CSV/JSON upload) to sell speed (4-week pilot).
    *   *v1.1 Plan:* Standard API connectors for SAP S/4HANA.

*   **[EXCLUDED] Real-Time IoT Machine Telemetry**
    *   *Reason:* Too much noise. Executives don't need second-by-second energy data; they need *allocated* energy per order.
    *   *v1.1 Plan:* Aggregation layer to ingest IoT data into the Allocation Engine.

## 2. Modules & Scope

*   **[EXCLUDED] Raw Material Provenance (Blockchain)**
    *   *Reason:* Commodity feature. Everyone has "traceability". Zero@Production focuses on "Operational Footprint".
    *   *v1.1 Plan:* Partnership integration (don't build, integrate).

*   **[EXCLUDED] Social Compliance Audits (Labor)**
    *   *Reason:* Qualitative data. Hard to put into the "Allocation Formula".
    *   *v1.1 Plan:* Risk-flagging only (Red/Green), no deep audit management.

---

## 3. User Experience

*   **[EXCLUDED] Native Mobile App (iOS/Android)**
    *   *Reason:* The OS is a "Control Room" experience (Desktop/Tablet). Executives view dashboards on iPads (Web), not phones.
    *   *v1.1 Plan:* "Zero Pocket" — Read-only alerts for executives.

*   **[EXCLUDED] "Self-Service" Custom Report Builder**
    *   *Reason:* Dilutes the "Standard". We provide the *correct* way to view data (CEO/CFO lenses). Custom reports lead to "vanity metrics".
    *   *v1.1 Plan:* Limited filter sets, but no "drag-and-drop" chaos.

## 4. The "Anti-Roadmap" (Things we will NEVER do)

*   **Employee Surveillance:** We will never track individual employee movements for Scope 3. (Violates Privacy-Safe Allocation).
*   **Greenwashing Generator:** We will never add "Offset Marketplaces" directly into the dashboard to "hide" emissions. The OS reveals the truth; it doesn't sell erasers.
