🌍 ZERO@PRODUCTION

Operating System for Sustainable Production

⸻

Sustainability didn’t fail.

Fragmentation did.

Factories track emissions.
Suppliers send spreadsheets.
Logistics sits somewhere else.
Employee transport is ignored.

Executives are left with dashboards —
but no decisions.

⸻

Zero@Production changes that.

Zero@Production is not software that reports sustainability.
It is an Operating System that governs it.

One system.
One logic.
One decision layer.

⸻

What makes it an Operating System?

An operating system does not optimize parts.
It coordinates the whole.

Zero@Production connects:
	• 	Product & Order data
	• 	Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 realities
	• 	Financial exposure
	• 	Executive decision flows

into one operational truth.

⸻

Decision-first. Always.

Every module follows one rule:

If it doesn’t drive a decision, it doesn’t exist.

No decorative charts.
No vanity KPIs.
No “Unknown” numbers.

Only:
	• 	What is material
	• 	What is risky
	• 	What can be acted on

⸻

Built for executives.

Not analysts.

Zero@Production speaks three languages —
without changing the interface.

CFO sees:
	• 	€ exposure
	• 	Cost per ton CO₂
	• 	Optimization leverage

CEO sees:
	• 	Direction
	• 	Reputational risk
	• 	Organizational maturity

Operations sees:
	• 	Inefficiencies
	• 	Switches
	• 	Actions

Same screen.
Different meaning.

⸻

Scope 3 is where the system proves itself.

Anyone can measure factory emissions.

Zero@Production governs what others avoid:
	• 	Logistics
	• 	Suppliers
	• 	Employee Transport

Not as “extra modules”
but as organizational carbon that must be owned, allocated and decided.

⸻

Employee Transport is the proof.

If the OS can:
	• 	Allocate commuting emissions
	• 	Explain their financial impact
	• 	Turn them into executive action

then it can govern any production system.

Employee Transport is not about buses.

It is about:
	• 	Scope ownership
	• 	Decision clarity
	• 	Management literacy

⸻

Order-centric by design.

Every impact eventually lands somewhere.

Zero@Production allocates:
	• 	Organizational carbon
	• 	Shared emissions
	• 	Operational risks

down to the order and product level —
audit-safe, conservative, explainable.

Not because regulation asks for it.
Because management needs it.

⸻

One click. One story. One insight.

Zero@Production is demo-safe by design.

Executives don’t explore.
They experience.
	• 	One click → CFO shock
	• 	One click → CEO board view
	• 	One click → Procurement risk

The system speaks for itself.

⸻

Not a tool.

Not a dashboard.
Not a platform.

An Operating System.

⸻

Closing line (locked):

This is where sustainability stops being abstract
and starts being operational.
