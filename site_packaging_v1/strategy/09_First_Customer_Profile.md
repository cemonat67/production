# Zero@Production — First Customer Profile (ICP)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** LOCK  
**Purpose:** Define who we sell to (and who we run from).

---

## 1. The "Green Light" Customer (Ideal Client)

We are looking for **Complexity**, not simplicity.
The Zero@Production OS shines where fragmentation is high.

### **Profile:**
*   **Type:** Integrated Textile Manufacturer (Vertical or Multi-Facility).
*   **Scale:** $50M+ Annual Revenue.
*   **Operations:** Spinning, Knitting/Weaving, Dyeing/Finishing, Garment (at least 2 of these).
*   **Market:** Export-oriented (70%+ exports to EU/US).
*   **Pressure Point:** Facing CSRD (Europe), CBAM, or intense pressure from Tier-1 Brands (Zara, H&M, Nike, etc.).
*   **Data State:** Has data, but it's a mess (Spreadsheets, isolated ERP modules, disconnected logistics).

### **Why them?**
*   They have the "Allocation Problem" (Shared resources across multiple production lines).
*   They have the "Executive Disconnect" (CEO promises net-zero, Operations manages daily chaos).
*   They can pay for "Governance", not just "Reporting".

## 2. The "Red Light" Customer (Do Not Sell)

We avoid simple operations where an "OS" is overkill.

### **Profile:**
*   **Type:** Small Cut & Sew Workshop (Fason).
*   **Scale:** <$5M Revenue.
*   **Operations:** Single process only.
*   **Market:** Local domestic market only.
*   **Pressure Point:** None (Just wants "cheapest certificate").
*   **Data State:** Non-existent.

### **Why avoid?**
*   They don't need an Allocation Engine; they need a calculator.
*   They don't have "Executive Lenses"; the owner is the operator.
*   They will churn because the system is "too complex" for their simple needs.

## 3. The "Pilot Champion" (Who buys inside?)

We do not sell to the Sustainability Manager.
We sell to the **COO** or **CFO**.

*   **Sustainability Manager:** Wants a report generator (Competitor territory).
*   **CFO:** Wants to know financial exposure and audit risk (Zero@Production territory).
*   **COO:** Wants operational control and one version of the truth (Zero@Production territory).

**Target:** The executive who is tired of "Sustainability" being a separate department.
