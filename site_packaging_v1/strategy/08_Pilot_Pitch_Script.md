## 1. The Hook (0:00 - 1:00)

"Gentlemen/Ladies,

We need to be honest about something.
Sustainability initiatives didn't fail because we lack data.
They failed because we are drowning in the *wrong* kind of data.

You have factories tracking emissions.
You have suppliers sending spreadsheets.
You have logistics sitting in a completely different silo.
And you have employee transport—your organizational footprint—being completely ignored because it's 'too hard' to measure.

You have dashboards. But you don't have decisions.

Today, I'm not here to show you another sustainability reporting tool.
I'm here to show you an Operating System."

---

## 2. The Solution: Zero@Production OS (1:00 - 2:30)

"What is the difference?
Software reports what happened.
An Operating System governs what *should* happen.

Zero@Production connects your Product Data, your Scope 1, 2, and 3 realities, and your Financial Exposure into one operational truth.

We call it 'Order-Centric Architecture'.
Because in your business, everything starts and ends with an Order.

If we can't tell you the carbon cost *and* the financial risk of Order #10492, then we are just making noise.

Let me show you. (Show *Employee Transport* or *Fabric DPP*)

This isn't just 'tracking buses'.
This is an Allocation Engine.
We take the total organizational footprint—the messy, shared reality of running a massive company—and we allocate it down to the kilogram of production.
Audit-safe. Privacy-safe. Decision-ready."

## 3. The Proof: The "Allocation" Argument (2:30 - 3:30)

"Why does this matter?
Because measurement is easy. Allocation is hard.

Anyone can put a meter on a machine.
But who tells you how much of your employee commuting footprint belongs to that specific shipment of Denim going to Germany?

Zero@Production does.
We don't track employees (privacy risk).
We track the facility's pulse and allocate it by weight (audit defense).

This means when the CFO asks, 'What is our exposure on this contract?', you don't give a vague estimate. You give a calculated metric."

---

## 4. The Ask: The Pilot (3:30 - 4:30)

"Here is my proposal.

We don't need a 6-month IT integration.
We don't need to rip out your ERP.

Give us **one facility**.
Give us **one month** of production data.
Give us **4 weeks**.

In 4 weeks, we will deploy Zero@Production as a parallel Operating System.
We will map your Scope 3 visibility.
We will give your executives the 'Decision Lenses'—CEO Risk View, CFO Impact View, COO Operational View.

We aren't asking you to buy software today.
We are asking you to pilot a new Decision Architecture."

---

## 5. The Close (4:30 - 5:00)

"The sustainability problem is not a data problem.
It is a decision architecture problem.

Zero@Production solves the architecture.
The data follows.

Let's start."
