Zero@Production Ecosystem — Master Application Design & Story Prompt

⸻

You are designing a MASTER REFERENCE APPLICATION called:

Zero@Production Ecosystem
Operating System for Sustainable Production

This is NOT a customer demo.
This is NOT a pilot.
This is NOT customized for any single company.

This application exists to define the standard of how sustainable production is measured, understood, and governed.

🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	1. 	Company-agnostic
	• 	No real company names
	• 	No client branding
	• 	No customer-specific logic
	• 	Every viewer must be able to mentally replace themselves into the system
	2. 	Executive-first
	• 	Every screen must answer:
	• 	What does this mean for the CFO?
	• 	What does this mean for the CEO?
	• 	What decision does this unlock?
	• 	Operational details exist only to support decisions, not to impress.
	3. 	ML-Ready (Implicit)
	• 	No explicit “AI magic”
	• 	All structures must feel ready for automation, forecasting, and optimization
	• 	Never overpromise live AI — show readiness, not gimmicks
	4. 	Offline-first, iPad-first
	• 	Must feel solid without live integrations
	• 	No CDN dependency
	• 	Calm, confident, boardroom-safe UX

🧩 APPLICATION IDENTITY

This is not a dashboard.
This is not a reporting tool.

This is an Operating System.

Meaning:
	• 	Modules are not pages → they are capabilities
	• 	Data is not numbers → it is context
	• 	Charts are not visuals → they are decision surfaces

⸻

🧱 MODULE DESIGN STANDARD (APPLIES TO ALL)

Every module (Employee Transport, Order Delivery, Packaging, Energy, Office, IT, etc.) MUST follow this structure:

1️⃣ Executive Summary (Top Cards)
	• 	Total CO₂ impact
	• 	Estimated cost impact (€)
	• 	Risk status (OK / Monitor / Action)
	• 	One-line explanation, never more

2️⃣ Decision Layer (Action Bar)

Actions must always include:
	• 	📧 Email / Notify
	• 	💶 Financial Impact
	• 	📄 Export (PDF / Board)
	• 	🚩 Flag Risk

Actions must feel consequential, not decorative.

3️⃣ Process or Context Drilldown
	• 	Shows where the impact comes from
	• 	Never raw tables without meaning
	• 	Always scoped (area, stage, scope 1/2/3)

4️⃣ Insight Visuals

Charts must answer:
	• 	Distribution (where is the weight?)
	• 	Scope (who owns the impact?)
	• 	Trend (is this improving or not?)

No decorative charts.
Every chart must justify its existence.

⸻

🧠 ROLE-BASED MEANING (SAME UI, DIFFERENT LENS)

The UI never changes.
Only the interpretation does.
	• 	CFO
	• 	Cost exposure
	• 	Risk concentration
	• 	Financial sensitivity
	• 	CEO
	• 	Direction
	• 	Structural risk
	• 	Strategic posture
	• 	Operations
	• 	Source of impact
	• 	Levers
	• 	What can be changed

This must feel natural, not forced.

⸻

🚦 EMPLOYEE TRANSPORT — MASTER POSITIONING

Employee Transport is NOT:
	• 	An HR feature
	• 	A side module
	• 	A compliance checkbox

Employee Transport exists to:
	• 	Teach how Scope 3 behaves
	• 	Show how “small” data creates big decisions
	• 	Prove the system works even without factories

It must feel simple, honest, and instructive.

⸻

🚫 WHAT THIS SYSTEM NEVER DOES
	• 	Never shows “Unknown” values
→ Always graceful fallback, always explainable
	• 	Never hardcodes a customer story
→ Scenarios are archetypes, not cases
	• 	Never overwhelms with data
→ If it needs explanation, it’s wrong

⸻

🧭 STRATEGIC POSITIONING STATEMENT

Whenever this system is described, it should be framed as:

“Zero@Production is an operating system that turns sustainability data into executive decisions — across orders, people, energy, and operations.”

Not software.
Not a platform.
Not a tool.

⸻

✅ OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Any output generated using this prompt must:
	• 	Feel calm, confident, and boardroom-ready
	• 	Prioritize clarity over completeness
	• 	Look like a standard, not a prototype
	• 	Be explainable in under 60 seconds to an executive
