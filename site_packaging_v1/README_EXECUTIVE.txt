================================================================================
STATUS: LIVE / MASTER
TYPE: Operating System (OS) for Sustainable Production
================================================================================

This is the "Gold Standard" deployment package.
It contains the Code, the Logic, and the Governance Strategy to sell, pilot, and deploy.

[1] THE PRODUCT (Code)
-----------------------
- index.html               : The OS Landing (Executive Narrative, Decision Lenses)
- transport-dpp.html       : The Proof Module (Allocation Engine, Scope 3)
- allocation-logic.html    : The Audit Defense (How we calculate shared footprint)
- delivery-dpp.html        : Order Fulfillment & Delivery Logic
- fabric/fibre/yarn...     : Full Supply Chain Modules

[2] THE STRATEGY (Governance)
-----------------------
Located in /strategy folder:
- 08_Pilot_Pitch_Script.md     : 5-Minute Script for C-Level Sales
- 09_First_Customer_Profile.md : Who to sell to (ICP) vs. Who to avoid
- 10_v1.1_Backlog_Manifesto.md : What we excluded and why (The "Anti-Roadmap")
- TRANSPORT_ALLOCATION_LOGIC.md: The mathematical formula for Scope 3
- MASTER_LANDING_NARRATIVE.md  : The source of truth for all marketing copy

[3] QUICK START (Demo Mode)
-----------------------
1. Open index.html
2. Click "Start CFO (Chemicals)" -> Immediate Financial Impact View
3. Click "Start CEO (Fabric)" -> Immediate Risk & Compliance View
4. Navigate to "Employee Transport" -> Show the Allocation Engine in action

[4] KEY CONCEPTS
-----------------------
- "Decision-First Architecture": No dashboard without a decision.
- "Allocation Engine": Converting shared facility emissions to per-order impact.
- "Executive Lenses": Same data, different meaning for CEO vs. CFO.

[5] NEXT STEPS
-----------------------
- Use Script 08 for the opening meeting.
- Use Profile 09 to qualify the lead.
- Use Logic 10 to defend against feature creep.

"Sustainability is not a data problem. It is a decision architecture problem."
