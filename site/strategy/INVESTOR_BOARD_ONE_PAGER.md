# INVESTOR / BOARD ONE-PAGER — ZERO@PRODUCTION
**Confidential Strategy Document**
**Version:** v1.0 (Master Release)
**Focus:** Financial Risk & Decision Governance

---

## 1. THE HOOK
**"Green risk is no longer a PR problem. It is a balance-sheet item."**

We are witnessing the transition of sustainability from "Marketing" to "Liability". Companies that fail to operationalize this data will face direct margin erosion and regulatory penalties.

---

## 2. THE PROBLEM
**Sustainability software is broken.**
The market is flooded with "Dashboard Trash"—tools that visualize carbon footprints but offer no decision support.
*   **Data Disconnect:** Sustainability data sits in Excel or isolated silos, disconnected from ERP and Finance.
*   **No Action:** Executives see "Red Charts" but have no "Green Buttons". They can't act.
*   **Lagging Indicators:** Reports are generated annually (post-mortem), not operationally (pre-mortem).

**Result:** Companies are flying blind into a storm of CBAM taxes, energy volatility, and governance audits.

---

## 3. THE SOLUTION
**Zero@Production: The Decision Operating System.**
We don't build dashboards. We build a nervous system that connects the factory floor to the boardroom.
*   **P&L Integration:** We translate carbon/energy data into financial impact (Cost/Margin).
*   **Risk Governance:** We flag compliance risks (CBAM, CSRD) before they become penalties.
*   **Executive Lenses:** Same data, different views for CEO (Risk), CFO (Cash), and OPS (Efficiency).
*   **Offline-First & Secure:** No cloud dependency for core ops. Your data stays yours.

**Value Prop:** *"We don’t sell sustainability software. We sell visibility into financial risk caused by sustainability decisions."*

## 4. WHY NOW? (The Perfect Storm)
The "Green Liability" era has arrived.
1.  **CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism):** Carbon is now a tax on imports to the EU.
2.  **CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive):** Non-financial reporting is now mandatory and auditable.
3.  **Energy Volatility:** Fixed energy costs are dead. Dynamic pricing requires dynamic production planning.
4.  **AI Cost Explosion:** The hidden "Shadow Carbon" of AI/Cloud infrastructure is blowing up IT budgets.

---

## 5. WHO PAYS & WHY?
We target the "Check Writers" who own the risk:
*   **The CFO:** Pays to stop **Margin Erosion**. (Visibility into energy/logistics costs per unit).
*   **The CEO:** Pays for **Governance Assurance**. (Board-ready compliance status).
*   **The CIO:** Pays to control **Cloud/AI Costs**. (Shadow carbon and vendor lock-in visibility).

---

## 6. BUSINESS MODEL (v1.0)
*   **Phase 1: The Pilot (Fixed Fee):** 4-6 week rapid deployment. "Show me the data."
*   **Phase 2: The License (Annual Recurring):** Per-facility or per-module licensing.
*   **Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Expansion):** Supplier integration and Network Network effects.

---

## 7. THE ASK
**We are ready for deployment.**
*   **Target:** Strategic Pilot Partners (Manufacturing, Retail, Logistics).
*   **Goal:** Validate the "Decision Engine" in a live P&L environment.
*   **Next Step:** 30-Minute "Governance Shock" Demo. (No slides, just software).
